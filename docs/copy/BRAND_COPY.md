# Defrag Brand Copy — DO NOT CHANGE

This file documents **canonical brand copy** that should NOT be modified during routine polish, refactoring, or "copy refinement" passes.

## Hero Headline (Homepage)

```
Old technology. Updated interface.
```

**Rationale**: This is the core brand positioning. "Old technology" refers to ancient symbolic systems (astrology, Human Design, Gene Keys). "Updated interface" positions Defrag as a modern way to access these systems. Do not change to generic "understand yourself" messaging.

## Hero Subheadline

```
Defrag synthesizes ancient symbolic systems—Astrology, Human Design, Gene Keys—into structured self-reflection, so you can act with timing, not urgency.
```

**Note**: Use em-dash (—) not hyphen (-). Capitalize system names.

## Taglines (Locked)

- "Signal first. Action second."
- "A Mirror, Not a Mandate"
- "Not predictive. Not diagnostic."
- "— lenses, not labels"

## CTA Copy

- Primary: "Initialize the Mirror"
- Secondary: "See how it works"
